# PermittivityProject_Documentation
This repository is used to store the documentation for the permittivity project: "A low-cost and portable stand-alone system for permittivity measurement". 
The project was completed as a part of my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Pune, India.
